Data from Mongo is a big dictionary
Let a for loop find all the interesting keys and push the value to another variable
Just format the output in a list or something
Import it in Postgres

for document in allDocuments:
  print("Now processing document " + index(allDocuments[document]) + " of " + len(allDocuments))
  for key in document:
    if key is in keyList:
      if key is list:
        Flatten that shit
      else:
        parsedDocument.append(key:document[key])









    namedict = ({"first_name": "Joshua", "last_name": "Drake"},
                {"first_name": "Steven", "last_name": "Foo"},
                {"first_name": "David", "last_name": "Bar"})

    print("""INSERT INTO bar(first_name,last_name) VALUES (%(first_name)s, %(last_name)s)""", namedict)

    executemany(query, vars_list)

    query = """INSERT INTO #table(#fieldname1, #fieldname2) VALUES ( %(#valuename1)s, %(#valuename2)s )"""

    Get data from MongoDB as dictionary
    Find all fields and paste them into the query
    Find all values and paste them as values

    for key in MongoData:
        if key in keylist:
            processedDocument[key] = MongoData[key]
